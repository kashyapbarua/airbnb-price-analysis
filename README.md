# Airbnb Market Insights and Analysis

### Who is Airbnb?
Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app.

### Why this data and problem interests me?
The motivation behind the project is to leverage the open data made available by Airbnb, on one of the most popular data platforms Kaggle, to draw insights from the data and try to answer some of the questions/hypothesis that we formulated at the beginning. This project is based on the Airbnb dataset for the cities Boston and Seattle, and the project is based on the Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM). We try to answer the following questions with the help of data analysis and Machine Learning (optional):
* Which category of property type tend to be at a pricier end?
* Is there a relationship between the prices and the region where the property is located?
* Which times are the best to travel to these cities?
* Are the quantity of reviews and prices correlated to each other?

### What are the contents of the repository?
* A [juptyer notebook](https://github.com/kashyapbarua/airbnb-price-analysis/blob/main/DataScientist_Project-Airbnb.ipynb) containing the analysis and insights
* Datasets contained in individual folders [Boston](https://github.com/kashyapbarua/airbnb-price-analysis/tree/main/airbnb_boston), [Seattle](https://github.com/kashyapbarua/airbnb-price-analysis/tree/main/airbnb_seattle)
* [Readme](https://github.com/kashyapbarua/airbnb-price-analysis/blob/main/README.md) file explaining the project motivation and other contents
* [Assets](https://github.com/kashyapbarua/airbnb-price-analysis/blob/main/assets) has all the supporting charts from the analysis

### Packages used in the project

`numpy`
`pandas`
`seaborn`
`matplotlib.pyplot`

### What are the key findings and insights from the analysis?
There are certain factors that facilitates in the variation of the property prices in the cities of Boston and Seattle. Consumers consider a lot of factors before booking any property for stay and through the data, we find some of the relations and insights to help make informed decisions.

* Some of the columns were cleaned to facilitate function building and seamless analysis process
* Charts have been plotted at different levels to perform univariate and bivariate analysis between the variables in the dataset
* Markdown offers the findings and insights present in the notebook, which is further publised here [Medium](https://medium.com/@kashyapbarua/comparative-analysis-between-boston-and-seattle-airbnb-prices-c10815af536a)

### Future scope of work
In the future, we will find the most significant variables from the dataset and also apply some data cleaning and feature engineering processes to build our predictive models.

We will also try to do a comparative analysis between different models and their performances in terms of predicting prices in both/either one of these cities.
